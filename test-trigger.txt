ðŸ”§ Testing Environment Variables Fix ðŸ”§

This PR tests the corrected systemd service configuration:
- EnvironmentFile=/opt/qalia/.env âœ…
- Service restarted with daemon-reload âœ…
- Should now have access to:
  â€¢ GITHUB_APP_ID
  â€¢ GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET  
  â€¢ GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY
  â€¢ OPENAI_API_KEY

Expected behavior:
1. GitHub sends webhook to /webhook endpoint âœ…
2. Service loads environment variables from .env file âœ…
3. Creates GitHub client successfully (no more "GitHub App ID not configured" error)
4. Qalia clones demo-web-app repository
5. Serves the app locally on port 8080
6. Playwright analyzes the web application  
7. AI generates comprehensive QA report
8. Posts analysis as PR comment
